# monkeyshock (azure)
Repository for all the code I'm using for experimenting and having fun playing with Microsoft Azure Cloud. Lots of ugly, untested code, so please do not copy-paste it into your production environment ;)
Coupled to the monkeyshock (power platform) repo (https://github.com/gashupl/monkeyshock)
